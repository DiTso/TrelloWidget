## Tools and Tech
* [Trello's API](http://trello.com/docs)
* [Volly](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley.git) - http handling
* [Gson](http://sites.google.com/site/gson/) - json parsing
* [Holo ColorPicker](http://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker) - color picker dialog
* [Calendar Widget](http://github.com/plusonelabs/calendar-widget) - inspiration

## How to Build
Building should be smooth using android studio and gradle, 
but since Volley is not (officially) available as a gradle dependency we need to [clone and import it as a separate module] (https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html).

## Contributing
Please open an issue before attempting to contribute any code. That way we can discuss what it is that's going to be implemented and make sure it aligns with the rest of the app.
